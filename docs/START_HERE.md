# START HERE: Welcome to AI Crew Commander v3.0

Welcome, Commander! This guide will get you up and running with your new AI-powered development environment.

## 1. What is This?

AI Crew Commander is a professional-grade platform that combines a full suite of editing tools with a crew of 22 specialized AI agents. You can write code, edit documents, design images, and more, all while collaborating with an AI team ready to assist with any task.

## 2. Quickest Start

Follow the instructions in `QUICK_START.md` to install dependencies and launch the application. The main steps are:

1.  **Install:** `npm install`
2.  **Configure:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Gemini API key.
3.  **Launch:** `npm run dev`

## 3. The Interface

The UI is divided into three main panels:

1.  **File Explorer (Left):** Browse and select files from your project.
2.  **Editor (Center):** The selected file opens here. This panel adapts to the file type (code, image, etc.).
3.  **AI Assistant (Right):** Chat with your AI crew, see the agent roster, and manage tasks.

## 4. Your First Command

Once the application is running, select a code file like `src/App.jsx` and ask the AI Assistant:

> "Review this component and suggest one performance improvement."

Watch as Commander Renee delegates the task to the appropriate specialist and delivers a response.

**You are now ready to command your crew. Good luck!**
